# CSRC juniors circuits

To keep you busy over the Christmas holiday, I've put together a circuit for you to do. This is optional, but I'd encourage you to do this 2/3 times a week while we don't have training sessions.

## The warm up

1. **10 mins dynamic warm up**

   The usual: inchworms, leg and arm swings, instep lunch, spiderman crawls etc...

2. **5 (each side) x Turkish Get Up** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgd8n917Zv0))

   Balance a shoe on your fist to keep your arm stretched up, and keep your eyes on that oustretched fist. Progression: use a kettlebell or dumbell if you have one.

## The circuit

Do this as many times as you like, I'd recommend 2-3.

1. **Drop squat, between 45-60 seconds** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voJ1KrwEIcc))

   The only addition I'd make to the video above is that you should start on tiptoe. Swap sides half way through. Progression: hold a weight above your head while you're on your toes and drive the weight down while you drop into a squat.

2. **Drop lunge, between 45-60 seconds each side** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIyClWP4tCM))

   The video includes dumbells, but you can just use your body weight. Again, rise up on to your tip toes before dropping down into the lunge. Progression: use weights as in the video, or hold a weight one side and drive that weight up as you drop into the lunge.

3. **Superman holds, between 45-60 seconds each side** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcgUQgt6F-Q))

   Do the same movement as in the video, but hold the oustretched pose for 3-5 seconds. Progression: lift the foot of the leg that you're kneeling on off the floor.

4. **Hip hinge, between 45-60 seconds each side** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Q_AcWXLXCWg))

   This is what I usually call runner's lunge, but seems like most other people don't call it that! Anyway, you'll see in the video. Progressions: using weights, as demonstrated in the video.

5. **Press ups, between 45-60 seconds**

   Whatever works for you: [wall push ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YB0egDzsu18), [knee push ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWxvty2KROs), [standard push ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IanIC-ZwacM), [bear push ups](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Me0Qj4qAClE)...

6. **Tricep dips, between 45-60 seconds** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnt7HBOvUj8))
   
   See the video for variations.

7. **Leg raises, between 45-60 seconds** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp4BlxcFTkE))
   
   Try to keep your feet off the floor throughout, move slowly and purposefully.

8. **Russian twist, between 45-60 seconds** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyUqwkVpsi8))
   
   Reach out further to make this harder, or use a weight.

## The cool down
   
1. **Turkish Get Up, 5 each side** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgd8n917Zv0))

   Yes again! Balance a shoe on your fist to keep your arm stretched up, and keep your eyes on that oustretched fist. Progression: use a kettlebell or dumbell if you have one.

2. The same set of static stretches that we do at the end of our sessions.
